# This is a list of blogs which have served me as references for basic concepts in ML

1. [Machine learning mastery] (https://machinelearningmastery.com/start-here/) 

2. Learned about the definitions of Bias and Variance here -- https://towardsdatascience.com/systematically-tuning-your-model-by-looking-at-bias-and-variance-4986662315b2
Also helped me understand how to leverage bias and variance to create a better fitting model using hyperparameter tuning.

3. Bias/Variance tradeoff explanation -- https://towardsdatascience.com/understanding-the-bias-variance-tradeoff-165e6942b229

4. A nice explanation of Softmax regression -- http://deeplearning.stanford.edu/tutorial/supervised/SoftmaxRegression/

5. Decision trees basics and hyperparameters -- https://towardsdatascience.com/a-guide-to-decision-trees-for-machine-learning-and-data-science-fe2607241956 and
