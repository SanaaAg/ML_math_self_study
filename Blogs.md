# This is a list of blogs which have served me as references for basic concepts in ML

1. [Machine learning mastery] (https://machinelearningmastery.com/start-here/) 

2. Learned about the definitions of concepts Bias and Variance here -- https://towardsdatascience.com/systematically-tuning-your-model-by-looking-at-bias-and-variance-4986662315b2
Also helped me understand how to leverage bias and variance to create a better fitting model using hyperparameter tuning.
